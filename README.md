## Functionality

This application has two pages.  The main page displays the three book categories or shelves. Users has the options to display and move the books into any category or not to display the book at all.

The second page is where users can search a book by title or author. A chosen book can be categorized and it will be displayed on the main page.  Please note that the search keywords are limited and listed on a separate file in this repository.
